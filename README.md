# WA-GPS
A simple GPS for freshmen navigating Westford Academy

This HTML file was written over the summer of 2018 and only added to GitHub during September of 2019.
Users can input their course schedule by inputting room numbers in Westford Academy and the block that starts the day to generate instructions to and from each class.

#Instructions
A couple of notes on the usage of the GPS:

- Keywords 'band', 'gym', 'piano lab', 'lunch', and 'library' can be used in place of room numbers
- It is implied that the student should continue straight between each instruction
- The entrance to band is considered to be the stairs beneath the main stairwell
- The entrance to lunch is considered to be the doors across from guidance
- The entrance to the gym is considered to be the doors by the water fountain

#Accessibility
An option to use elevators instead of stairs is also available
